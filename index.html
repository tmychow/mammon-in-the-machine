        <h1>Mammon in the Machine</h1>
        <p> The greatest wealth creation event in human history is approaching. </p>
        <p> Today, we stand at the precipise of a transformation that will dwarf the Industrial Revolution, the advent of electricity, and the rise of the internet combined. The advent of artificial general intelligence - true, human-level AI - is no longer a fantasy. </p>
        <p> Instead, it is happening in front of our eyes: the exponential improvements in capabilities, the feverish capital deployment by hyperscalers, as well as the quiet (and not-so-quiet) stockpiling of compute resources by nations. </p>
        <p> Within our lifetimes, we will see the marginal cost of intelligence plummet. Consider what happens when cognition becomes too cheap to meter. Entire industries will be rendered obsolete overnight, while others will explode into existence and create trillions in value. </p>
        <p> Yet the market still prices securities as if we're in an ordinary tech boom, as opposed to the civilisation-altering force AGI truly represents. This is perhaps the greatest asymmetric betting opportunity of our generation. </p>
        <p> As reality catches up to these possibilities, where does value accrue? </p>
